# Hand Gesture Recognition Project

This project focuses on recognizing hand gestures using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with TensorFlow and Keras. The model is trained on a dataset of American Sign Language (ASL) gestures to classify different signs. The labels for the gestures have been personalized to fit a specific language or context.

## Project Overview

- **Dataset**: American Sign Language (ASL) Dataset.
- **Model**: CNN-based model trained for gesture recognition.
- **File Structure**:
  - `ASL_Dataset/`: Contains the gesture images used for training.
  - `gesture_recognition_model.keras`: Saved model for gesture recognition.
  - `Train.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for training and testing the gesture recognition model.
  - `requirements.txt`: Dependencies required to run the project.
