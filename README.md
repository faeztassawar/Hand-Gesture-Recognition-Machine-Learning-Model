# Hand-Gesture-Recognition-Machine-Learning-Model
A deep learning project to recognize hand gestures using TensorFlow and Keras, trained on the American Sign Language (ASL) dataset but with some change in labels of gestures to personalize this dataset. The model leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify gestures with high accuracy.
